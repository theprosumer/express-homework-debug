## DEBUGING

1.  First try to get the express server running.
2.  Are you reading the terminal, do you have to install modules?
3.  Create five routes, two that render a handlebar page, two that render json, and one that sends a message text.
4.  move the styles folder, into the public folder.
5.  Think about why you are doing that ^.
6.  Link up one of you handlebars page with the css in the styles folder.
7.  debug and fix the gulpfile


## This is going to be hard, use the reference of the app you made earlier, READ your terminal errors,
## stack overflow errors, everyone has gotten the errors you are getting!

### Is nothing happening, is your server running, did you restart your server?


### Think about what the client is ? what is your server doing?
